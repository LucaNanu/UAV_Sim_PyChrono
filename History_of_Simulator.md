# Milestones of this Simulator

[January 2024] The paper "A Hybrid Model Reference Adaptive Control System for Multi-Rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles" by M. Gramuglia, G. M. Kumar, and A. L'Afflitto is presented at AIAA SciTech in Orlando, FL

[December 2023] Co-advised by Dr. L'Afflitto, Mattia Gramuglia defends the MS thesis "Design and High-Fidelity Simulations of an Adaptive Control System for X8-Copters Employed for Payload Delivery". As part of this thesis, PyChrono is used for the first time to simulate autonomous UAVs
